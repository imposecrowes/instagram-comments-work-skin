                        Replace "alt" with "character name's profile picture" (ex. Crowley's profile picture) for screen readers
                        Instagram would actually have "serpent666's profile picture as the alt"
                        idk if that's confusing for readers to have to keep track of who the usernames belong too unless they're not supposed to know yet
